# DiscordCsvDataEmbed
Fetch certain data from csv file located in discord main() root folder and send it to "discord channels/DM users" as an Embed. 

This is just an example on how you can make use of discord API with pandas to create various phenomenal applications related with CSVs or JSON. 

->If you are running the code on replit, then you might wanna install panda package separately.

->I have attached csv and output screenshot about how this works for your reference.
